                <h2>Our principles :</h2>
                <h3>Sustainability</h3>
                <p>We don’t have resources to waste. Your compact and performant website can use less energy. There is the Website Carbon tool to measure it, and assure your visitors that your site is really eco-friendly.</p>
                <h3>Impactful Design</h3>
                <p>Your website will distinguish you from the competition. We will look at the industry in which you operate and design a specific visual impression. It is easier for customers to return to pages that they remember.</p>
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>Over 66% of your visitors will use mobile devices — often browsing your website in unpredictable situations. Around 15% of your guests have disabilities and must use the page in a very specific way. To make their — and your — life easier, we incorporate Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) in the design process.</p>
                <h3>Performance</h3>
                <p>Your page will be fast and compact. Compact pages are efficient and can be really fast — to keep attention and be accessible in all circumstances. Last but not least — Google loves them.</p>

                <h2>Case study :</h2>
                <h3>Sustainability</h3>
                <p>Keeping a page on the server and uploading it consumes energy. The smaller the page, the less resource it consumes. This website is cleaner than 90% tested by the Website Carbon.</p>
                <h3>Impactful Design</h3>
                <p>The client really wanted generative graphics to be an element of the website design. We used a dynamic algorithm to generate unique graphics that change with each page refresh.</p>
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>All websites of public entities in the European Union must meet the requirementsof the WCAG 2.1 AA standard from 23 September 2020. Since accessibility is not only about appearance, but also content, we have provided content creators with a tool for convenient communication on the web.</p>
                <h3>Performance</h3>
                <p>Well thought-out design, a template created from scratch, no unnecessary functionalities and optimized images make the website compact and fast.</p>
